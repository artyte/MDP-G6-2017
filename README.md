Instructions for adding new files:
- Use folders to represent the work you're doing (e.g. in this case, android team does work on Robot Remote Folder)
- Branching isn't really necessary if you're trying to code on separate pages

Status:
- Added bluetooth discovery
- Added ListView bluetooth view
- Added refresh bluetooth list button (Not working properly yet)
