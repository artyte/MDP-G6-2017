This is the folder for RPi source codes

How the RPi routes the transmitted data to the respective mediums (i.e PC, Nexus and Arduino Board) is based on the header or the first character 
in each string that is sent:

1. 'a' for Arduino board. (e.g aF1, the arduino board will receive the message "F1")
2. 'b' for Nexus
3. 'p' for PC
